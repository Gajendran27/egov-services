## Bad Data Generator

To generated ba data for an API from Swagger 2 API Contract. Write a spec in below format

```yaml
ignorefields: ["tenantId", "RequestInfo", "auditDetails", "requestInfo"]
contract: https://github.com/egovernments/egov-services/raw/master/docs/swm/contract/v1-0-0.yaml
output_folder: ./swm/

apis:
  /vendors/_create:
    reference:
      servicedLocations: #mdms::egov-location::TenantBoundary/[?(@.hierarchyType.code=='REVENUE' )]
      servicesOffered: #mdms::swm::SwmProcess
    generated:
      vendorNo:

  /vehicles/_create:
    ignorefields: ["vehicleType"]
    reference:
      vehicleType: #swm
      fuelType: #swm
      driver: #swm
      vendor: #transaction,vendorNo
    generated:
      regNumber
```

**ignorefields**: This is the list of fields that needs to be ignored by data gen. The list specified at the top level is applicable for all `apis` listed in the spec
**contract**: Path/URL to the Swagger API 2 contract YAML
**output_folder**: The folder where each of the data gen file needs to be generated

**apis**: List of API paths from the contract yaml for which bad data needs to be generated. The path needs to match exactly with the path in the contract

For each api path, below mentioned fields can be specified
  - **reference**: This object will have name of each field which either a master data reference or a transactional data reference
  - **ignorefields**: This is array of additional fields which needs to be ignored for the given API
  - **generated**: This object will have the name of each field which is actually generated by the API and returned in response

The sample format of generated test cases is shown below:

```json
[
  {
    "field_name": "name",
    "type": "required",
    "subtype": "missing",
    "operations": [
      {
        "json_path": "$.vendors[0].name",
        "value": "##delete##"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "field_name": "name",
    "type": "length",
    "subtype": "maximum(256)",
    "operations": [
      {
        "json_path": "$.vendors[0].name",
        "value": "{{$randomString(257)}}"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
